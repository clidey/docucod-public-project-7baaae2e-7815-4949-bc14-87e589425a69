## Accessing Dark Reader Extension

After installing Dark Reader, the first step is to access the extension to begin configuring your preferences. You can find Dark Reader as an icon near your browser's address bar (toolbar). Clicking this icon will open the extension's main interface, where you will control how dark mode is applied to websites.

If you do not see the icon immediately, ensure it is enabled in your browser's extensions menu. Pinning the extension for quick access is recommended for a smoother experience.

## Setting Up Your First Preferences

Once you open Dark Reader, you will be presented with basic controls to personalize your web browsing experience. The primary goal here is to set your global dark mode preferences that apply across all websites by default.

- **Toggle Dark Mode On/Off:** Use the main switch to enable or disable dark mode globally.
- **Choose a Filter Mode:** Select from options such as Dynamic, Filter, or Static to control how dark colors are applied:
  - *Dynamic*: Automatically adjusts colors for a natural dark appearance.
  - *Filter*: Applies a grayscale or inverted filter.
  - *Static*: Uses fixed colors that you can customize.
- **Adjust Brightness and Contrast:** Use sliders to fine-tune brightness, contrast, and sepia tone for better readability and comfort.

These settings form the foundation of your dark mode experience. Your preferences take effect instantly on all open tabs.

## Applying Dark Mode to Web Pages

With your preferences set, Dark Reader will transform websites into dark mode automatically. You can test this on popular sites by navigating to them and observing the change.

Additionally, individual site controls allow you to override global settings:

- **Site List Management:** Use '+' or '-' icons to add or remove websites from your dark mode list.
- **Site-Specific Settings:** Access the extension while on a site and configure custom brightness, contrast, or disable dark mode for that site only.

These controls provide flexibility, letting you maintain a consistent dark theme where desired.

## Practical Tips for Smooth Configuration

- Start with the default 'Dynamic' filter mode for the most natural appearance.
- Adjust brightness and contrast gradually to avoid strain.
- Use site-specific toggling to exclude sites with display issues.

<Tip>
If dark mode does not apply immediately, refresh the web page or restart your browser to ensure settings activate correctly.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Configuration Issues

- **Extension Icon Missing:** Verify that Dark Reader is enabled in your browser extensions and pin it to the toolbar.
- **No Dark Mode Effect:** Confirm that global dark mode toggle is on; look for site-specific exclusions.
- **Visual Artifacts or Color Issues:** Switch filter modes or reset brightness/contrast to defaults.
