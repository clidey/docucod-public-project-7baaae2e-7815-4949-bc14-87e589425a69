## Supported Platforms and Browser Compatibility

Dark Reader enhances your web browsing experience by applying a customizable dark theme to supported browsers and platforms. To ensure optimal performance and full functionality, it is important to understand where and how the extension works best.

### Supported Browsers

Dark Reader is compatible with major modern browsers that support extensions from respective web stores. The following browsers are officially supported:

- **Google Chrome:** Full support via Chrome Web Store extension.
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Supported through Firefox Add-ons.
- **Microsoft Edge:** Available in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store.
- **Apple Safari:** Supported with some limitations; requires Safari 14 or later on macOS.
- **Opera:** Compatible via Opera add-ons.

### Supported Operating Systems

Since Dark Reader functions as a browser extension, compatibility depends largely on your browser and its underlying OS support. The extension works on:

- **Windows:** Versions 7 and later are generally supported.
- **macOS:** macOS 10.14 Mojave and newer, including native Safari support.
- **Linux:** Any modern distribution supporting the above browsers.
- **Android:** Limited support via Firefox for Android (experimental).

Note that full feature availability and smooth performance require using the latest browser versions.

### Prerequisites for Installation

To successfully install and run Dark Reader, you need to address a few system and browser requirements:

- A compatible browser from the list above, updated to the latest stable release.
- Access to the official browser extension stores to download and install Dark Reader.
- Internet connectivity to fetch updates and theme data during usage.
- Sufficient permissions during extension installation to allow theme modifications.

### Browser-Specific Notes

Some differences and limitations exist due to browser extensions APIs:

- **Safari** users must enable Dark Reader manually in Safari Extension preferences and keep Safari updated to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Firefox**'s Android support for Dark Reader is experimental and may lack full functionality.
- **Edge Chromium** uses the same extension system as Chrome, so compatibility is equivalent.

### Verifying Prerequisites

Check your environment with these simple points:

- Confirm your browser version supports extensions and is one of the supported browsers.
- Verify that access to browser extension marketplaces is unrestricted (some environments block these).
- Inspect your operating system version meets the minimum stated requirements.
