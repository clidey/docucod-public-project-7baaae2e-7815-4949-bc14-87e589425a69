## Confirming Dark Reader is Active and Functional

After installing and configuring Dark Reader, it's essential to verify that it is properly enabled and applying dark mode as expected. This page guides you through a simple verification process to ensure your installation is working, providing confidence that Dark Reader is active and your browsing experience will reflect the expected dark theme.


## What to Expect When Dark Reader Is Active

Dark Reader modifies the appearance of websites by applying a dark color scheme dynamically. When it is active and functioning correctly, you should observe:

- Backgrounds switch from light to dark shades.
- Text and UI elements become lighter to ensure readability.
- Images and buttons retain usability without visual glitches.
- The Dark Reader icon in your browser toolbar shows it is enabled.

These visible changes confirm that the extension is modifying styles on the current page.


## Verifying Dark Mode on a Webpage

To confirm that Dark Reader is active, follow these steps on any website you visit.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open a Website">Navigate to a commonly visited website with a predominantly light interface, such as https://example.com or your favorite news site.</Step>
<Step title="Observe Color Changes">Check if the website background changes from white (or light) to various dark shades with contrasting text, indicating Dark Reader's active dark mode.</Step>
<Step title="Check Browser Toolbar Icon">Look for the Dark Reader extension icon in your browser's toolbar. It should appear highlighted or in an enabled state when dark mode is active.</Step>
<Step title="Enable or Toggle Manually (if necessary)">If you don’t see changes, click the Dark Reader icon and toggle the dark mode switch to ON. Refresh the page and observe changes again.</Step>
<Step title="Verify Basic Features">Ensure site elements like links, buttons, and images display properly without distortion or poor contrast.</Step>
</Steps>


## Troubleshooting Basic Visibility Issues

If dark mode does not seem to apply correctly, consider these common causes:

- **Extension Disabled:** Verify the Dark Reader extension is installed and enabled in your browser extensions manager.
- **Site Exclusion:** Check if the current site is on Dark Reader's exclusion list and remove it if needed.
- **Conflicting Extensions:** Disable other browser extensions that may interfere with page styling.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure your browser version supports the installed Dark Reader extension.

<Tip>
Refreshing the page or restarting the browser often resolves transient issues with styles not applying correctly.
