## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

Setting up Dark Reader should be seamless, but sometimes unexpected hiccups can arise during installation or initial use. This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve typical problems to get your dark mode experience running smoothly without delay.

### Frequently Encountered Issues

Many users face repeatable issues that can prevent Dark Reader from functioning properly, especially during the first install or configuration steps. Understanding these common problems can save you time and frustration.

- **Installation did not complete properly**: Missing files or incomplete installation can stop Dark Reader from activating.
- **Dark mode not toggling on websites**: Some sites may resist theme changes due to conflicting extensions or browser settings.
- **Interface buttons missing or unresponsive**: The extension toolbar icon or context menu options might be hidden or disabled.
- **Performance slowdowns or browser crashes**: Resource usage spikes if other extensions conflict or outdated browsers are used.
- **Settings not saving or reverting on reload**: Configuration persistence issues can arise if permissions or storage access is limited.

### Steps to Resolve Setup Problems

Follow the step-by-step resolutions below to address these common difficulties and confirm Dark Reader activates as expected.
