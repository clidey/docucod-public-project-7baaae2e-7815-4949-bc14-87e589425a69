## Enabling Dark Reader to Transform Your Browsing Experience

Dark Reader intelligently applies a dark theme to web pages to reduce eye strain and enhance readability in low-light environments. This page guides you through activating Dark Reader, toggling dark mode on individual sites or globally, and managing persistent settings for a comfortable, customized viewing experience.

Whether you're just starting or want quick toggling techniques for different browsing contexts, this guide provides clear, actionable steps to master dark mode activation. The process is straightforward and takes just a few minutes.


## Preparing to Activate Dark Mode

Before enabling Dark Reader, ensure you have the extension installed and your browser supports it. Dark Reader works on all major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

Keep in mind:

- Dark Reader requires permission to access the sites where you want dark mode enabled.
- Make sure any conflicting extensions or browser settings (e.g., native dark modes) are disabled or properly configured.
- If you prefer a quick toggle without changing global settings, Dark Reader's popup provides instant control.

Visit the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/quick-setup/installation-guide) to confirm your setup and the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/quick-setup/system-prerequisites) for compatibility.

## Ensuring a Smooth Dark Mode Experience

After toggling dark mode, verify the visual changes to confirm activation. Common indicators include a darker background, lighter text, and inverted bright colors.

To verify activation:

- Check the Dark Reader icon; when active, it typically changes appearance or color.
- Open the popup and confirm the 'On' state for the current site or globally.

<Tip>
If dark mode does not activate on a site, ensure the site is not excluded in your site list and that Dark Reader has permission to run on it.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Conflicts with website-native dark themes or other theme extensions may cause inconsistent results. Disable other similar extensions when troubleshooting.
</Warning>


## Best Practices and Troubleshooting Tips

- Regularly review and update your site exclusions to avoid unintended dark mode blocks.
- Use the per-site toggle to handle sites that do not render well with dark mode.
- Customize brightness and contrast for optimal comfort as ambient lighting changes.
- If dark mode suddenly stops working, verify extension updates and browser version compatibility.
- Clear browser cache and reload pages when changes don’t immediately apply.
